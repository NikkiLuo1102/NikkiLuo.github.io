HI! I'm Shihan, an MPhil student majoring in computational media and arts (CMA) from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. My research interest includes Human-Computer Interaction, Accessibility, Virtual Reality, and Social Computing.

I'm a group member in [APEX Lab](https://www.mingmingfan.com/lab/) at HKUST. We are working to make computing more accessible and usable to everyone.

You can find my CV here: [Shihan's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
