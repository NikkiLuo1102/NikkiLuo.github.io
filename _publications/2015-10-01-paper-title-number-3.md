**Abstract**   
Virtual reality (VR) and associated technologies have rapidly grew, creating new opportunities for improving mental health. In order to provide an immersive and concentrated meditation experience, this paper offers the idea of VR-assisted meditation, which integrates the advantages of VR technology with mindfulness techniques. The suggested technique, which is known as LOOP Meditation, is mainly aimed toward novice meditators and places a strong emphasis on the value of movement and breath awareness when meditating. Existing VR experiences and meditation applications sometimes ignore the value of including physical movement, which can improve mindful body sensations and maintain interest. By creating software that incorporates body movement and breath sensing into virtual reality surroundings, LOOP Meditation addresses this gap. 
The LOOP Meditation design and implementation are examined in this paper along with its possible advantages and consequences for people looking to develop their meditation practice. A pilot research comparing the efficacy of this strategy to conventional meditation techniques is offered. The study's findings add to the expanding body of knowledge on VR-assisted meditation and demonstrate how it may have a positive effect on mental health.
